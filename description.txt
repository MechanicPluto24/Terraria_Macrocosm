Macrocosm is a mod for Terraria aimed at allowing players to take to the stars upon the defeat of Moon Lord, enabling exploration of the entire solar system.
Each world offering valuable resources, unique challenges, dangerous bosses, and deep lore.
Using the Subworld Library, players can explore far and wide, from the acidic sulfur plains of Venus, to the rusting ruins of Mars, to the methane mire of Titan, to the frozen wastelands of Pluto and beyond.
