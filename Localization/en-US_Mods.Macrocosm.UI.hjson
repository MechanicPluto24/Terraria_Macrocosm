	Moon: {
		Moon_Tip1: You've taken your first step into a larger world.
		Moon_Tip2: The Moon takes much longer to rotate than the Earth. Make sure you have enough supplies to last through the night!
		Moon_Tip3: Is the Moon really made of cheese? Dig down to its core to find out.
		Moon_Tip4: Even on this airless rock, life finds a way. Always remain on guard.
		Moon_Tip5: Take advantage of the Moon's low gravity, but remember your enemies will do the same.
		Moon_Tip6: When the sanguine hour comes, it's time to hide.
		Moon_Tip7: No atmosphere means no fire, but there are other ways of illuminating the darkness.
		Moon_Tip8: Beware of solar storms!
		Moon_Tip9: Moon Lord was just the beginning. What other horrors await you on our silver satellite?

	Earth: {
		Earth_Tip1: Returning for a beer?
		Earth_Tip2: If you think you have enough electricity, you definitely don't.
		Earth_Tip3: Normal gravity too punishing after a trek in space? Try getting your boots upgraded with some advanced grav-tech!
		Earth_Tip4: You can customize your rocket! Give it a new coat of paint, fly your favorite flag, give it a name!
		Earth_Tip5: Try to use multiple sources of electricity. You never know when it's suddenly going to start raining.
