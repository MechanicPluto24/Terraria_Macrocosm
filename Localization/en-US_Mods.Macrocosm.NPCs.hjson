		Rescued1: Wow, it's bright! How long was I out for, I swear I only took a nap for a moment! ...Oh, you killed that big monster that ate me. Well, thank you!
		Rescued2: Thank you very much for rescuing me! It was starting to get a little stuffy in there! You must be a brave champion to have come out all this way. Like me!
		Rescued3: Woah, thank you human! You saved me from that frightening space monster! Perhaps...you are also a champion of the Moon, as I am!
		Day1: The Moon is not so bad once you get used to it! I personally find it quite beautiful! Just stay indoors during the night, I shall defend you from those evil Moon monsters!
		Day2: I found an old space lander once! It looked abandoned, and there was this weird pole with cloth attached to it. Do you know anything about this?
		Day3: Earth looks very pretty! I went to visit it once, the President of the planet gave me a cookie!
		Day4: Am I a good Moon Champion? Of course! If I wasn't a good Moon Champion, I wouldn't be sitting here discussing it with you now, would I?
		Day5: What was I doing on the Moon before I got eaten? I was fighting Moon monsters, of course!
		Day6: A meteorite hit me on the head today. How rude!
		Day7: Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do! Not that I'd want to, it's so pretty to look at!
		Day8: What a wonderful place my Moon is, isn't it? Nothing but silver plains and dunes as far as the eye can see, amidst an inky black sky! ...And Earth's there, too!
		Day9: Have I ever told you how much I love my Moon?
		Night1: Human, I am curious, is the Earth made of cheese?
		Night2: Stand alert, human! Nighttime lasts far longer than it does on Earth, and lots of scary monsters emerge from the craters and shadows looking for food!
		Night3: You look troubled, are you afraid of those Moon monsters? Do not be, for I will defend you! Those Moon monsters will never defeat me!
		Night4: Yes, nighttime is finally here! This is the time my Moon offers some of its most challenging foes, and a true Champion will never shy away from a fight!
		Night5: A while back, I discovered I could tune in on human conversations if they were happening close enough to the Moon! I kept hearing the word 'Houston' come up in their conversations. I haven't heard from him in a while...I would like to meet this Houston some day!
		Night6: Space is so cool! There are thousands of billions of billions of stars and galaxies! There is nothing I like more than space...well, except my Moon, of course!
		Night7: Why do I love my Moon so much? ...I'm not sure! I've been here since I first woke up, and it's captivated me with its beauty! It also keeps my senses and skills sharpened with its ceaseless monsters and challenges! It makes me feel alive!
		Night8: So many Moon monsters out tonight...plaguing, desecrating my Moon. I shall kill all of them, and you shall help me!
		Advice1: Don't forget your spacesuit, human! I don't know why, but it always makes me feel weird whenever I take it off, so I never do!
		Advice2: Monsters on my Moon drop these shiny gemstones, and I love keeping them! I'll gladly take them in exchange for some supplies I...found!
		Advice3: Be prepared for anything, and stay alert! The Moon is a very dangerous place crawling with all kinds of monsters, prowling the surface or crawling deep below!
		Advice4: Take caution when going deeper into the Moon's caverns, many of its monsters HATE light! ...Why do they hate light? I'm not sure! They might be scared of it.
		Advice5: There's an old human Moon base not far from here! I'd go explore it if I were you, but be careful! I don't think everything in there is entirely dead just yet!
		BloodMoon1: Finally! The challenge I have been waiting millennia for... Stand back, human. This fight is MINE!
		BloodMoon2: I have never felt so ALIVE. I wish this night to never end, I will return drenched in blood!
		BloodMoon3: I LOVE THIS WORLD. IT GIVES ME NO SHORTAGE OF CHALLENGE, OF THRILL, OF BLOOD. I WILL BLEED AND SPILL FOR MY MOON.
		BloodMoon4: Get inside. Now.
		SolarStorm1: You should get inside, human! The Sun has sent a volley of interlopers here to my Moon, but they won't live long enough to tell the tale!
		SolarStorm2: WOW, the Sun is bright today! More so than usual...but not the brightest I've seen it. You should have been there, human; there was no shortage of things to kill!
		SolarStorm3: The Sun appears angry, human! Beware, sometimes frightening monsters ride the solar winds here, and they are not to be trifled with!
		SolarStorm4: Do you taste metal, human?
